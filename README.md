# Joke Teller App with JS

## About The Project

By using 'Joke API' together with 'Voice RSS' documentation, we're able to create text-to speech joke telling app. With a press of a button, you get told a new programming joke. Honestly, some of them are silly. But this is a fun way to learn the methods or apply it to your projects.
Please note that you can use the api key in the code, since it's not attached to important data. However, best practice is to use your own and of course hide it through your server shall you decide to publish it :).

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code (download live server extension) and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
